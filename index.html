      <h2>Life and Ministry</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>c. 4 BC</strong> - <p>Born in Bethlehem of Judea to the Most Holy Theotokos, the Virgin Mary, fulfilling the prophetic words of the Prophet Saint Isaiah:</p>
          <quoteblock> "Behold, a virgin shall concieve, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanual" (Isaiah 7:14)</quoteblock>
          <p> In humility, the King of Glory took flesh and was laid in a manger. His family fled to Egypt under threat of Herod, prefiguring His later rejection by the world. Raised in Nazareth under care of His Most Pure Mother and the righteous Joseph the Betrothed, Christ was known as the Son of the carpenter, yet He was and is the Creator of all.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>c. 30 AD</strong> - <p>At about thirty years of age, Christ apporached the Jordan river and was baptized by Prophet St. John the Forerunner. As He emerged from the waters, the heavens were opened, and the voice of the Father was heard:</p>
          <quoteblock>"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." (Matthew 3:17)</quoteblock>
          <p> The Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove, revealing the Holy Trinity to the World.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>c. 30-33 AD</strong> - <p>For three years, the Lord preached the Gospel of the Kingdom, healed the sick, cast out demons, gave sight to the blind, and raised the dead. He spoke in parables and fulfilled the Law and the Prophets. He called twelve apostles and taught them to live in humility, love, and self-denial. In Him was no sin, yet He dined with sinners and touched the unclean, revealing divine compassion.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>c. 33 AD</strong> - </p>Betrayed by one of His own, arrested, and brought before Pontius Pilate, He was unjustly condemned and crucified at Golgotha.</p>
          <quoteblock>"He humbled Himself and became obedient unto death--even death on a cross." (Philippians 2:8)</quoteblock>
          <p>He bore the sins of the world, opening the gates of Paradise to all who belive.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>c. 33 AD</strong> - <p>On the third day, He rose from the dead, trampling down death by death and upon those in the tombs bestowing life. The Resurrection is the center of all Christian hope; the victory of Life over death, and Light over darkness.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>c. 33 AD</strong> - <p>Forty days later, Christ ascended into the heavens and sat at the right hand of the Father in His glorified body. Ten days after, on the feast of Pentacost, He sent down the Holy Spirit upon the apostles as tongues of fire, empowering the Church to proclaim the Gospel to the nations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Jesus Christ is worshipped as the eternal Son of God, the second person of the Holy Trinity, consubstatial with the Father and the Holy Spirit. He is believed to be both fully divine and fully human (hypostatic union), having taken on human nature to redeem mankind, offering believers union with God (Theosis). Through His Incarnation, life, Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension, He restores fallen humanity and unites earth to heaven. He is "the Light of Light, true God of true God," and in Him, all things are made new.</p>
